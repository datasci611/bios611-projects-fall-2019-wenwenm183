## Project description, purpose, and goals
  Project is designed to conduct analysis on data from Urban Ministries of Durham (UMD) using R markdown. 
  The purpose of this project is to use existing data from UMD and demonstrate different analyses that can be conducted using R markdown. 
  The goal of this project is to produce useful analyses to assist UMD's goal of providing support and preventing homelessness in North Carolina.
  
## Data sources and attributions
  The dataset is provided by UMD, which consist of 18 variables, which are date service received, client file number, client file merge number, bus tickets, notes of service, food provided for food, pounds, clothing items, diapers, school kits, hygiene kits, referalls, financial support, type of bill paid, payer of support, field1, field2, field3. 
  
 ## Analysis Approach
  I hope to address the questions such as how have different service requests change over time, which services are being most frequently requested in the last years, and how often do clients return to UMD for support. 
  The three variables I will be using are date when services are received, client file number, and notes of service. 
  One analysis approach I will take is to use plots to show possible trend of service requests that may have changed over time.
