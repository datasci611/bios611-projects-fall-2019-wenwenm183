Overall you have done a really nice job.
You communicated clearly in your readme file about what project goal
is, what dataset to use, who audience are and what problems to explore. 
It is interesting to learn what is the relationship between visiting 
pattern and all the other attributes about the population. One advice
about the scope of the project would be, if you could add one more
dimension into your analysis, such as year/month data. For now, the 
information is mixed in the whole time duration. It would be more helpful
if UMD staff could gain more insight from you plot about what time has
played a role in these relationships, either about their clients or services.

Your Python file has done a good job wrangling the dataset. Your R file does the
plotting, especially you adding the lables the color scaling to make the plot perfect. 
Another thing you could improve later on is to use Make and Docker file to organize
your workflow of project. It not only help users to run your whole project at 
a time, it could also serve as an ideal interpreter of what role each file is
playing in general. 

And if time allows, you could add more comment to clearly define each section
of the code along with your result and conclusion. 
Looking forward to your final project!
